# Equity Hammer - universal Windows entry point (PowerShell).
#
# One command for a Windows client, pasted into PowerShell:
#
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamfoehammer/install/main/install.ps1 | iex
#
# What it does:
#   1. Checks whether WSL is installed with at least one Linux distro.
#   2. If NOT: offers to run 'wsl --install' (needs admin + a reboot), then
#      tells the user to reboot, finish the Ubuntu user setup, and paste the
#      same line again.
#   3. If YES: hands off into the distro and runs the universal install.sh,
#      which detects Linux and launches the Jarvis WSL bootstrap.
#
# A bash script cannot detect that it is being pasted into PowerShell, so this
# small shim is the Windows-side front door. Everything after WSL is ready runs
# through the same install.sh that Mac and WSL users hit directly.
